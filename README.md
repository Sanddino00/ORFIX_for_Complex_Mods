I made a tool with the help of Ai to add the run lines (ORFIX / NNFIx) to more Complex toggle mods with a single ini and normal merged.inis

Please only run it in the folder of the broken mod not the generall mod folder because it will break all mods. 

How to use it:

Place the tool into the folder of the mod you want fixed and run it.

Renamed ps-t0 =... to ps_t1 =...  press y only if everything else doesn't work.

Subfoldersearch yes / no depending where you put it.  e.g. 

Mods>Lumine+this tool>Folder of your mod 
Mods>Lumine> Your mod+ this tool

Exclusions for the different parts. Y to exclude N to include them. (Might need to exclude the face)

You want to confirm the changes to the included parts y / n.

If it didn't work use the backup and try different inclusions / exclusions for the parts.  

A few tips:
For skirk mods atleast from LewdLad you need to exclude the LimbsBody Section otherwise they will turn red.
This tool could have problems if the facefix tool is ran before but it also might work it is still a bit janky sorry for that
Also if you use Gimi get the latest ORFix and ORFixApi  https://github.com/leotorrez/LeoTools/tree/main/releases
